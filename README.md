# ReactJS Redux Boilerplate
## A ToDo Example

#### Instructions
```bash
:$ npm install
:$ npm run watch
```

#### Summary
This boilerplate contains a simple ToDo list, without persistence. It's possible to add new items and marks them as done. It uses webpack to bundle scripts and to generate css from sass files.

These sass files are required directly from ReactJS components.
